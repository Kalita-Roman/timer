# Copilot Configuration

## Project Context
This is a simple Node.js Express server project that demonstrates basic web server functionality.

## Coding Preferences
- **Language**: JavaScript (Node.js)
- **Style**: Use modern ES6+ syntax
- **Formatting**: Standard JavaScript formatting
- **Comments**: Add comments for complex logic only

## Framework Patterns
- **Express.js**: Use standard Express patterns for routing and middleware
- **Error Handling**: Always include try-catch blocks for async operations
- **Response Format**: Use consistent JSON response format

## Suggestions Focus
When providing code suggestions:
1. Prioritize simplicity and readability
2. Suggest Express.js best practices
3. Include proper error handling
4. Use appropriate HTTP status codes
5. Keep the project lightweight

## File Organization
- Keep main server logic in `index.js`
- Add route handlers inline for simplicity
- Only separate concerns if the project grows significantly

## Dependencies
- Prefer built-in Node.js modules when possible
- Only suggest new dependencies if they add significant value
- Always consider the minimal nature of this project
